    <h1>What is XML?</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XLM was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
        <li>XLM tags are not predefined.You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XLM uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong> (DTD) or an <strong>XLM Schema </strong> to describe the data</li>
        <li>XLM with a DTD or XLM Schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The main difference between XML and HTML </h2>
      
    <p><Strong>XLM was designed to carry data.</Strong></p>
    <P>XML is not a replacement for HTML.</P>
    <p>XML i not a replacement for TTML. <br> XML and html were designed with different goals :</p>

    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is. <br> HTML was designed to display data and focus on how data looks.</p>

    <p>XML is about displaying information,While XML is about describing information.</p>

    <h2>XML does DO anything</h2>

    <p><strong>XML was not designed to DO anything.</strong></p>
    <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understand,but XML does not DO anything. XML was created to estructure,store and to send information.</p>

    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from jani,store as XLM:</p>

    <p>The note has a header and a message body.it also has sender and creceiver information.But still,this XML document does not DO anything.it is just pure information wrapped in XML tags.Someome must write a piece of software to send,receive or display it.</p>
